# README

This repo contains 10 javascript files, each containing some broken code. Your job is to figure out the type of error for each file and perform simple fixes.

The examples include code that we likely haven't covered in class yet which means that some of the solutions will require a bit of searching and reading documentation.

## Instructions

1. Download or fork this repo
2. In each file, identify the type of issue and the specific issue
3. Create a `console.log()` that indicates the type and explanation
4. Comment out the broken code with a multiline comment
5. Rewrite the code with a fix

## Debugging Tips

- Read the Error Messages: The browser's console often provides helpful clues about the type and location of the error.
- Check Syntax: Look for missing semicolons, parentheses, quotation marks, etc.
- Test with Small Inputs: Start with simple test cases to isolate the problem.
- Use console.log: Print out variable values at different points to track how they change.
- Comment Out Code: Temporarily disable sections to narrow down the source of the error.
